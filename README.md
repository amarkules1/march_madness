## What is this thing gonna look like?
1. it should scrape data from the web on the results of games on a regular basis
2. it should store the data in a database for further use
3. it should be able to predict the outcome of future games based on the data it has
4. it should have backtesting capabilities to see how well it would have done in the past
5. it should have an API that can be used to make those predictions and to display predictions from the past
6. it should eventually have a shiny web interface

## What are the steps to get there?
1. Start scraping data on games
2. Set up a db table that matches the structure of the data collected
3. set up a way to trigger scraping of new games
4. Differentiate between regular season and tournament games
